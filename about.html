            This page will me all about me. In fact, I will put a link here for people to download a copy of
            my resume and will actually summarize my resume information here as well.<br>
            Information on my school history, my degrees, work experiences, skills, and other information which
            would normally see on LinkedIn would be here along with a photo of myself.<br>
            <br>
            This page is a stub. More information and expansion will be needed.
