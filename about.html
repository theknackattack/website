                    This page will me all about me. In fact, I will put a link here for people to download a copy of
                    my resume and will actually summarize my resume information here as well.<br>
                    Information on my school history, my degrees, work experiences, skills, and other information which
                    would normally see on LinkedIn would be here along with a photo of myself.<br>
                    <br>
                    This page is a stub. More information and expansion will be needed.
